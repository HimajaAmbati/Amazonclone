I've meticulously replicated Amazon's main page using HTML and CSS. To achieve this, I've meticulously crafted two files: "index.html" for HTML markup and "style.css" for the CSS code. In the "index.html" file, I began by constructing a header featuring a navigation bar and a panel bar housing introductory details about the website. Following this, I dedicated a section to the core content, showcasing materials available for purchase. However, for simplicity, I've included only a handful of items. To round off the page, I've appended a footer, enriching the website with additional information such as policies and more. This endeavor has allowed me to delve into the intricacies of web development, honing my skills in HTML and CSS while simulating the renowned interface of Amazon.
